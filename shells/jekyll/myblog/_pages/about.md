Hello! I'm Tyler, an IT professional with a passion for technology and a love for exploration. I was born in Tennessee but spent most of my life in the sunny state of Florida. My journey in the field of Information Technology began during my active duty service in the Army from 2019 to 2025, where I served as a 25B, an Information Technology Specialist.

During my time in the military, I had the incredible opportunity to travel across Europe and Asia, visiting seven different countries. These experiences not only broadened my horizons but also deepened my appreciation for different cultures and the world at large.

When I'm not immersed in IT projects or working on my homelab, you can find me enjoying a variety of hobbies. I love playing basketball and swimming, both of which keep me active and energized. Golfing is another pastime I enjoy, even though I'm still perfecting my swing! Hiking and exploring new places are activities I cherish, as they allow me to connect with nature and satisfy my adventurous spirit.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and enjoy diving into new IT challenges and technologies. Whether it's a complex project or a simple experiment, I believe that each endeavor is an opportunity to grow and innovate.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find my projects and insights both informative and inspiring. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to connect!
